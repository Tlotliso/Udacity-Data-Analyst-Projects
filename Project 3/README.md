## by Tlotliso Molapo


## Dataset

The dataset consists of loan data from Prosper. The datasets consists of 113,937 loans with 81 variables from loans approved by Prosper.
The dataset is part the visualization project of the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree and has been provided by Udacity.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration I found that there was a relationship between the value of the original loan amount approved for borrowers and the defaults. When comparing income categories and credit grades against whether the borrower had defaulted or completed their loan it was observed that in each category whether income or credit grade consistenly the defaults had a higher mean loan amount than completed loans.

Outside the main variables of interest I also looked at the relationship between home ownership and defaults. The relationship between home ownership and income categories and credit grades. I found that home ownership does not affect defaults, as the count borrowers with homes and the count of borrowers without homes had a similar count for defaults and completed loans.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I focused on the relationship between defaults and other features. The key features were the value of loans granted originaly, the credit grades and Income categories. I analysed how the mean original loan amounts were higher for defaults than for completed loans no matter the category of income ranges and credit grade.
