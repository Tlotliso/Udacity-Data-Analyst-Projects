# Imdb Dataset Exploration
## by Tlotliso Molapo


## Dataset

IMDB stands for internet Movie Database. The database is an online database on related films, tv shows and other media such as streaming content and video game. The data is provided by volunteers. Users rate titles on a scale of 1 to 10 - totals are converted to weighted mean-rating.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration I found that:
- The budget of the movie does not affect the vote average, with low budget and high budget movies getting around the same average vote average.
- The runtime does not affect the vote average.
- The highest rated genres on Imdb are Documentaries, History, Musicals and war movies.
